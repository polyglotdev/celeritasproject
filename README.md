# Celeritas

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/polyglotdev/celeritas.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/polyglotdev/celeritas)

This repo and package are for the [Let's Build a Go version of Laravel course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/lets-build-a-go-version-of-laravel).

I created a full package because I was having trouble with the `go get command`. I wanted to make sure that the package was available to everyone.
